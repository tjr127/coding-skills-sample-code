# Use the open method to open a file
# Pass in the name of the file to open and mode. 'r' for read only 'w' if you want to write to the file
# To write to this file we will use "w"
# If the file does not exist, it will be created.

import os

#change working directory as VS Code musses with it
os.chdir("/home/tjr127/projects/coding-skills-sample-code/coding205-writing-file-ga")
my_file_object = open("my-new-file.txt", "w")

my_file_object.write("The grey penguin flies at noon\nthis is a new line")
